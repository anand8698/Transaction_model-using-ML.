# Transaction_model-using-ML.
This project focuses on building a machine learning model designed to analyze, predict, and classify financial transactions. The model is trained on a dataset of transactions and can be used for various purposes such as detecting fraud, predicting transaction categories, or assessing transaction patterns.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned, normalized, and processed to handle missing values and outliers.
Feature Engineering: Creation of new features based on transaction history, user behavior, and time-based trends to improve model accuracy.
Model Selection: Various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost are tested and compared.
Fraud Detection: The model can identify potentially fraudulent transactions by analyzing anomalies in transaction patterns.
Transaction Classification: Classification of transactions into categories like utility payments, transfers, shopping, etc.
Model Evaluation: The performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Tools and Technologies:
Languages: Python
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Algorithms Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and others
Data Processing: Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for preprocessing
Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing transaction patterns and model performance
