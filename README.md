Transaction Fraud Detection Using Logistic Regression
This project aims to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent based on transaction data provided by a bank. By using binary logistic regression, the model determines whether a given transaction is classified as fraud or not, based on the available features in the dataset.

Key Features:
Binary Classification: Predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent using logistic regression.
Data Visualization: Uses scatter plots to visualize the relationship between transaction ID and fraud status, showcasing a sigmoid curve.
Model Training: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
